When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
   -- when you are sharing
   -- when you want a permanent/backed up version of your file

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-- the remote repository might contain incompatible changes with your repo
