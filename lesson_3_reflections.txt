When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
   -- when you are sharing
   -- when you want a permanent/backed up version of your file

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-- the remote repository might contain incompatible changes with your repo

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?
-- fork: like clone but copies a repo from a place on github to a place on github
-- clone: copies a remote repo to a local repo
-- branch: allows files of same name to exist in same repo but with different content.
You can have branches locally and/or remotely
