Note:
git init (to get started)

Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: Directory .git is created and the status of tracking your files is created inside that dir

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?  

A: Staging area shows you what will end up in the repository. It is
flagged as going in but not in the respository yet. It shows intention but
doesn't force you to put it there yet. Shows an intended action.
